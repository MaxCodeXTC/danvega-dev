Welcome to Coffee and Code with me, Dan Vega. This newsletter is a little insight into what I was up to this week, things I found interesting and anything on my radar for the upcoming week. If you don't already have a cup of coffee grab one now and let's get to it.

## Previous Week

This week I had a lot of fun writing a blog post on a free tool called The CSS Grid Generator and I am excited. Speaking of writing blog posts I have some very cool projects in the works that should help get my writing in front of more people which should lead to helping out a lot more people.

I told you that I got accepted to freeCodeCamp last week. This week I also had a really good meeting with a great person in the Vue community. I am going to be working on some content with him and I sent out this cryptic tweet to let everyone know what I was working on. ðŸ˜‰

### **Live Stream**

No live stream this week but I did send this tweet out that I would love your thoughts on.

### **Blog**

[Learn how to use CSS Grid with a free tool called CSS Grid Generator](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/08/08/css-grid-generator)

As someone who has been developing web applications for almost 20 years now, I have seen it all. I started in FrontPage, moved to Dreamweaver, nested tables inside of tables and learned how to float and clear fix everything.

While you won't see any awards for my designs on my bookshelf I am able to create some very nice simple and clean layouts. That said I have never really enjoyed it because it has always been a huge pain in the a\$\$. I have always felt like I was just hacking away until my layout looked almost like what I had in mind.

This is why when tools likeÂ [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)Â &Â [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)Â came along I was beyond excited about the possibilities of creating clean layouts. I think if you combine these 2 technologies along with just how far JavaScript has come it is what has really got me excited about front end development these days.

While I have a pretty good understanding of CSS Grid at this point I know it can be a little bit confusing to get started. That is why I am really excited to share with you a new tool that I came across that I really think can help you out if you're trying to understand CSS Grid.

## Upcoming Week

Now that our summer cohort students have graduated at [Tech Elevator](https://www.techelevator.com/) I think things should quiet down over the next month. I will be working on the 2 big articles I told you about earlier and trying to lock down a live streaming schedule.

PS - It's my birthday Wednesday so if you want to say hi on Twitter that would make an old man feel loved.
