There are a lot of things that I took for granted when using a proven blogging platform like WordPress. In WordPress when I created a new blog post and then shared it on Twitter I got this nice display of my blog post as apposed to just a link. 

This might not seem like a big thing to most but why write something if nobody reads it? Engagement is the name of game on social media platforms like Twitter and Twitter Cards (and images in general) are proven to increase engagement.In this article I will talk about what a Twitter Card is and how to add Twitter cards meta tags to your blog.

## What is a Twitter Card

## What are meta tags

When you're building out 


Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page’s content; the meta tags don’t appear on the page itself, but only in the page’s code. We all know tags from blog culture, and meta tags are more or less the same thing, little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.

The only difference between tags you can see (on a blog post, say) and tags you can’t see is location: meta tags only exist in HTML, usually at the “head” of the page, and so are only visible to search engines (and people who know where to look). The “meta” stands for “metadata,” which is the kind of data these tags provide – data about the data on your page.
