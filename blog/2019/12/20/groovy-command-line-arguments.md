I can't speak for everyone but for me one of the features that really got me excited about the [Groovy Programming Language](https://groovy-lang.org) was just how easy it was to get things done. While Java can be verbose at times Groovy cuts down on that and gives us the ability to create a quick script and execute it. What happens if you want to execute a script in Groovy and pass command line arguments to it? That is exactly what we are going to cover in this post.

I recently had a student in my Groovy course ask me a question about command line arguments and I thought it would share it with you.

<blockquote>
Hi Dan Vega. Can you pls help me on sample groovy script for command line argument

```groovy
def test(topic){
    println topic
}
```

In above program how can I pass topic from command line
</blockquote>

First off thank you for not only taking the course but also for asking this question. I think when developers see just how easy it is to start scripting in Groovy one thing you will end up doing is passing arguments to your script. I am going to answer the students question about command line arguments in a Groovy Script but then I will also discuss what you should do if you start to expand on this concept and want to build full blow command-line interface (CLI) applications.
