There is a back to (Tech) school sale going on over at [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/). One of the video series that caught my eye was [Berglund and McCullough on Mastering Grails 101](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024798.do) series. This looks like a pretty basic introduction to Grails but I really like the format. It is more of a round table discussion which I really like as its a nice break away from the normal tutorial style presentation. It is a little over a year and half old but it still covers Grails 2 and you get 3 hours and 20 minutes of video. Did I mention the price? With the 50% off you can get this whole series for $14.99. No reason not to pick it up today. Below is a small excerpt from the series.
