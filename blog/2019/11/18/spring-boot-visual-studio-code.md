## Why Spring Boot in Visual Studio Code?

In this tutorial, we are going to talk about using Visual Studio Code to create Spring Boot applications. I've been working a lot more on the front-end over the last year or two. As much as I love IntelliJ, I'm just more comfortable in Visual Studio Code and I don't like going back and forth. I don't like having like my Vue projects open in Visual Studio and then going over to IntelliJ to use Spring Boot & Java.

I've been using Visual Studio Code for a lot more development these days. I've been working with Java, Spring, C# and now Go, so I'm using Visual Studio Code more and more and more. Because I'm in it more, I'm just more comfortable with it.

Now, this is not to say to go out and replace whatever IDE you're used to. If you really like Eclipse and you really like IntelliJ IDEA, they're both fantastic IDEs. I'm not saying get rid of them. I'm just saying if you happen to work on projects like this where you might have a front-end application and a back-end application and you're just used to using Visual Studio Code, you can do so.

## Visual Studio Code Extension Packs

Before we get into how to do everything we need to talk about Visual Studio Code Extensions. I don't know if a lot of people know about this, but there are some really good extensions for Visual Studio Code if you're a Java developer. If you know that a developer is going to need a handful of extensions to get started with something, it can be frustrating to ask them to install a list of extensions.

- Spring Boot Extension Pack
